title:image classification using deep cnn and elm
proposed by zhuangzi 
    <image classification using convolutional neural networks and
    kernel extreme learning machines>

plan: ICIP   
deadline: 1.29.2020

project plan:
    1.implement the cnn pretrain by imagenet
    2.train this model by other dataset
    3.remove the softmax layer and record the feature
    4.implement the algorithm of kernel extreme learning machines
    5.
